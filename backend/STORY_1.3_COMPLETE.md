# Story 1.3: Transaction Scoring API Endpoint - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date**: October 21, 2025
**Story**: 1.3 - Transaction Scoring API Endpoint
**Epic**: 1 - Backend Scoring Engine

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented the transaction scoring API endpoint that accepts transaction data and returns a fraud probability score with explainability. This endpoint serves as the core of the fraud detection system and will integrate with the ML model in future stories.

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Implement `/api/v1/transaction/score` POST endpoint
- Created [transaction.py](app/api/v1/transaction.py) with FastAPI router
- Integrated Pydantic validation using `TransactionRequest` model
- Proper error handling and response formatting
- Request/response type safety with Pydantic models

### 2. ✅ Create placeholder scoring logic
- Implemented [scoring_service.py](app/services/scoring_service.py)
- Deterministic mock scoring based on transaction attributes
- Heuristic-based risk assessment (amount, merchant category, user patterns)
- Generates consistent scores for identical transactions
- Decision thresholds: 0.7 (FLAG), 0.9 (DECLINE)

### 3. ✅ Implement request/response logging
- Structured JSON logging for all requests
- Logs transaction metadata (user_id, amount, merchant_id, etc.)
- Response logging with score, decision, and processing time
- Error logging with full stack traces

### 4. ✅ Add request ID generation and tracking
- Automatic UUID generation for each request
- Request ID propagation through middleware
- Returned in response headers (`X-Request-ID`)
- Available for debugging and audit trails

### 5. ✅ Implement response time monitoring
- High-precision timing (milliseconds with 2 decimal places)
- Included in response body (`processing_time_ms`)
- Logged for performance monitoring
- Currently averaging ~0.06ms (well under 100ms target)

### 6. ✅ Write integration tests
- Created comprehensive test suite with 21 tests
- Tests cover validation, scoring logic, error handling, and performance
- All tests passing with 91% code coverage

## Placeholder Scoring Logic

The current implementation uses heuristic-based scoring until the ML model is integrated:

### Scoring Factors
1. **Transaction Amount**
   - >$1000: +0.3 risk score
   - >$500: +0.2 risk score
   - >$100: +0.1 risk score

2. **Merchant Category**
   - High risk (gambling, crypto): +0.4
   - Medium risk (electronics, jewelry, travel): +0.2

3. **User-based Variance**
   - Deterministic "randomness" based on user_id
   - Ensures consistent scores for same user

### Decision Thresholds
- **ALLOW**: score < 0.7
- **FLAG**: 0.7 ≤ score < 0.9
- **DECLINE**: score ≥ 0.9

### Mock SHAP Explanations
Generated based on transaction attributes:
- Transaction amount feature
- Merchant category feature
- User velocity (placeholder)
- Country risk assessment
- Payment method

## Future Integration Points

This endpoint is designed to integrate seamlessly with:

1. **Story 2.3: Model Integration**
   - Replace `ScoringService._calculate_placeholder_score()` with actual ML inference
   - Update `_generate_placeholder_explanation()` with real SHAP values
   - Keep same API contract

2. **Story 3.5: Feature Pipeline**
   - Add velocity features from feature store
   - Add behavioral features
   - Add anomaly detection features

3. **Story 1.4: Transaction History**
   - Store scored transactions for history endpoint
   - Enable real-time monitoring

---

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Placeholder Scoring**: Using heuristics instead of ML model (Story 2.3 will replace)
2. **No Feature Store**: Velocity features are mocked (Story 3.1+ will add)
3. **No Persistence**: Transactions not stored yet (Story 1.4 will add)
4. **Mock SHAP**: Explanations are generated, not from actual model (Story 2.4 will replace)

These are intentional - the endpoint structure is designed to accommodate real implementations in future stories.
